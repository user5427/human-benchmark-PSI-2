\sectionnonum{Introduction}
This work documents the Human Benchmark system that was developed in third semester. The system is a collection of mini-games that test various cognitive abilities such as reaction time, 
memory, and mathematical skills. The system is built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and ASPNet. The system is open source and the code is available on GitHub 
for anyone to use and contribute to.

This work will provide an overview of the system and its features. It will also discuss the demerits of the system and suggest possible improvements that can be made to the system.
The work will be divided into four main sections: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Section 1 will provide an overview of the system and its bussiness logic.
    \item Section 2 will focus on improvements that can be made to the system.
    \item Section 3 will -.
    \item Section 4 will -.

\section{System and bussiness overview}

This section will discuss about the Human Benchmark system and its bussiness logic. Strategies such as SWOT, MOST, SMART, etc. will be used to analyze the system and its features.


\subsection{SWOT analysis}

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique used to help a person or organization identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to business competition or project planning. It is intended to specify the objectives of the business venture or project and identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving those objectives.

Strengths:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enhance Cognitive function: studies indicate that faster reaction times (RTs) are associated with better cognitive functions, including memory, verbal fluency, processing speed, and intelligence.
    \item Increased Engagement through Gamification: Integrating game elements like leaderboards can enhance motivation and engagement in learning activities.
    \item Positive User Reception to Minimalist Design: Research indicates that all generations have a positive attitude toward minimalism in design.
\end{itemize}
Weaknesses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Risk of Overemphasis on Competition: While leaderboards can motivate some users, they may lead to feelings of sadness or disappointment among those who consistently rank lower, potentially decreasing engagement.
\end{itemize}
Opportunities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Personalized Learning Experiences: Incorporating adaptive learning technologies can improve training effectiveness and user satisfaction.
\end{itemize}
Threats:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Competition: The presence of similar apps or platforms offering reaction training poses a competitive threat.
\end{itemize}

Faster VRTs and ARTs are correlated with better academic performance among undergraduate students.
The results from our study indicate that faster RTs were one of the predictors of better academic performance among the recruited participants. Faster RTs are indicative of better cognitive functions, including memory and verbal fluency, processing speed, and intelligence 
Prabhavathi et al. studied the impact of RT on academic performance among undergraduate medical students. They found that students with faster RTs had higher academic scores, and they attributed it to better attention, concentration, cortical arousal and processing speed. \cite{CognitiveFunction}

Competition is one of the six established uses and gratifications for playing computer games (Lucas \& Sherry, 2004). This suggests that learning could become engaging and rewarding if perceived as being competitive, as competing may have been the reason for playing in the first place.
Studies have demonstrated that by offering challenges, gameplay can be both enjoyable and motivating, as challenges are almost inherently motivational.
The findings also imply that challenges may sometimes cause more frustration than enjoyment for students (Bopp, 2006; Simkins et al., 2012). The results from this review indicate that challenges could threaten engagement and learning if they do not match students’ abilities. \cite{GameplayEngagement}

Gamification elements to be adopted in online learning environments could be utilized as an innovative, fun, and stimulating way to show learners their progress. As one example, leaderboards could be used as a source of motivation for learners to embrace gamified learning environments because learners are 
able to see their activities being processed publicly and instantly and compare their progress with their classmates (Domínguez et al., 2013). Therefore, using leaderboards as external incentives is considered to improve learners’ academic performance (Mekler et al., 2017). Considering this argument, the 
positive effect of leaderboards on learners’ achievement was also in line with the findings of some other studies (Bai et al., 2021; Ibáñez et al., 2014; Landers et al., 2017; Landers et al., 2019; Mekler et al., 2017) claiming that leaderboards could directly or indirectly improve learners’ performance. 
On the other hand, the studies of Hanus and Fox (2015) as well as de-Marcos et al. (2014) contradicted with this finding by stating that learners’ scores could be lower even after participating in a gamified learning environment. 


Analysis Review Behind the Usage in Gamification pdf
On the negative aspects some users reacted with sadness
and disappointment with the leaderboard achievement, due
to low esteem created by the continuous defeat in the
leaderboard system by their peers (Fortunate \& Cruz, 2018).
This is more relevant in the world of online gam-ing, where
when cheaters or hackers constantly mod their games to their
advantage, resulting in the fall of usage by other normal
players. \cite{GamificationInEducation}

Similar to Kearney, we found that video games can stimulate your mind and benefit people’s cognitive skills. In a prior study, Klicka measured the effect of video games on college football players (5). He found that video gamers had faster reaction times and therefore may improve hand-eye coordination for a person. This relates to our study because, in our
experiment, the gaming group had significantly faster scores than the non-gaming group which supports my hypothesis. This suggests games might play a role in reaction time. \cite{ReactionTime}

% Mathematical formulas can be embedded in paragraphs of text by separating the formulas \LaTeX~code with \texttt{\$...\$}. Example: trigonometric identity $\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1$.

% However, formulas will look much nicer if they are separated into separate equations by placing the formula code in the environment \texttt{\textbackslash[...\textbackslash]}. Example of an equation:
% \[
% \ee^{i \alpha} = \cos{\alpha} + i \sin{\alpha}, \qquad \alpha \in \RR.
% \]
% The mathematical symbols $\RR$ and $\ee$ have been used in this equation, with the commands \texttt{\textbackslash RR} and \texttt{\textbackslash ee} defined at the beginning of this template. Sometimes formulas take several lines, e.g.:
% \begin{equation}
% \begin{split}
% 2&= 1+1+0=\left(\frac{\sqrt{16}}{\tan^2\pi/3+1}\right) +\ln\ee+\sin\pi\\
% &= (\sin^2 17+\cos^2 17)^{\ln\ee}+\cos 0 +(x^{1/\ln x})'. 
% \label{form1}
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% Don't forget to put a full stop (.) at the end of the formula if it is the end of a sentence. Also note the height of brackets with a large fraction inside \texttt{\textbackslash frac}, which is automatically adjusted with \texttt{\textbackslash left( ... \textbackslash right)} or specified with \texttt{\textbackslash big}, \texttt{\textbackslash Big}, \texttt{\textbackslash bbig}.

% \bigskip

% If the formula is needed later, it does not need to be rewritten each time. You can always quote the formula you need with the \texttt{\textbackslash eqref} command. For example, the formula with the number above is quoted as follows: equation \eqref{form1}. To do this, the \texttt{\textbackslash label} command must assign a temporary name to the formula, which \LaTeX~ will automatically change to the required number. More information on \LaTeX~mathematical symbols, equations, mathematical environments and commands can be found in this document \cite{amsdoc}.

% \bigskip

% Here are some more formulas that use more complex mathematical commands. Matrices and determinants are written using the LaTeX environments \texttt{pmatrix} and \texttt{vmatrix}:
% \[
% A= \begin{pmatrix}
%     0 & 1\\
%     2 & 3
% \end{pmatrix}, \qquad
% \det A =
% \begin{vmatrix}
% 0 & 1\\
% 2 & 3    
% \end{vmatrix} = 0 \cdot 3 - 1 \cdot 2 = -2.
% \]
% For more complex equations and matrices, the \texttt{mathtools} \cite{mtoolsdoc} commands are very useful. The \texttt{mathtools} package is included in the working template, so you can use its commands directly.

% The derivative is written using an apostrophe character (\texttt{'}), for example,
% \[
% (f(x)g(x))' = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x).
% \]
% Taylor polynomial:
% \[
% p(x) = p(a) + p'(a)(x-a)+\frac{p''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + ... + \frac{p^{(n)}}{n!}(x-a)^n.
% \]
% For writing simple and partial derivatives, differentials, gradients, etc., the template includes the very handy commands \texttt{\textbackslash dv} and \texttt{\textbackslash pdv}, \texttt{\textbackslash dd}, \texttt{\textbackslash grad} from the \texttt{physics} package \cite{physdoc}:
% \[
% \dv{f}{x},  \qquad
% \dv[2]{f}{x}, \qquad
% \pdv{f}{x},  \qquad
% \pdv[5]{f}{x} \qquad
% \pdv{f}{x}{y}, \qquad
% \dd{f}, \qquad
% \grad{f}
% \]

% To write the integral in an interval, use the \LaTeX command \texttt{\textbackslash int\textunderscore \{a\}\^{}\{b\}}:
% \[
% \int_{a}^{b}f(x) \dd x = F(a) - F(b) = \eval{F(x)}_{a}^{b}
% \]
% For writing multiple, surface, curvilinear integrals you can use the commands \texttt{\textbackslash iint}, \texttt{\textbackslash iiint}, \texttt{\textbackslash oint}, etc.
% \[
% \iint_{D}f(x, y)\dd{x}\dd{y},\quad
% \iint_{D} f(x,y)\dd{S}, \quad
% \int_{\gamma} f(x,y)\dd{l},\quad
% \oint_{\gamma} P(x,y)\dd{x}+Q(x,y)\dd{y}.
% \]

% \subsection{Matematinių rezultatų formulavimas}

% To formulate the mathematical results of your work, you should use environments
% \[
% \text{\emph{Definition}},\qquad \text{\emph{Proposition}}, \qquad \text{\emph{Theorem}}, \qquad \text{\emph{Lemma}},
% \]
% \[
% \text{\emph{Corollary}}, \qquad \text{\emph{Remark}}, \qquad  \text{\emph{Example}}, \qquad \text{\emph{Proof}}.
% \]
% These environments are already defined
% in your thesis template \texttt{VUMIFTemplateClass.cls}, by combining the standard \LaTeX\ commands
% \[
% \texttt{definition}, \qquad \texttt{proposition}, \qquad \texttt{theorem}, \qquad \texttt{lemma},
% \]
% \[
% \texttt{corollary}, \qquad \texttt{remark}, \qquad \texttt{example}, \qquad \texttt{proof}.
% \]
% \noindent Example of a definition:
% \begin{definition}
% A number $p \in \mathbb{N}$ is called a \emph{prime number} if it is divisible only by $1$ and itself. The set of prime numbers is denoted by $\mathbb{P}$.
% \end{definition}
% \noindent Example of a proposition:
% \begin{proposition}
% The average of the product of two independent random variables $X, Y: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is equal to the product of the averages of the two original variables $XY$:
% \[
% \EE{(XY)}=\int_{\Omega} X(\omega)Y(\omega)\dd\mu(\omega) = \EE{X} \cdot \EE{Y},
% \]
% provided that the means of $X$, $Y$ and $XY$ exist.
% \end{proposition}

% \noindent  Important mathematical statements are called \emph{theorems}:
% \begin{theorem}[First theorem on isomorphism]\label{teor1}
%     Suppose that $f: G {\rightarrow} H$ is a homomorphism between the groups G and H. Then the image $f(G)$ of the group $G$ is isomorphic to the factor group $G / \ker{(f)}$, that is
%     \[
%         f(G) \cong G \big / \ker{(f)}.
%     \]
% \end{theorem}

% \noindent The shorter auxiliary statements are called \emph{lemmas}. However, lemma formulations can also be quite complex:
% \begin{lemma}[Vector substitution lemma]\label{lem1}
%     Suppose that the vectors of the linear space V over the body k
%     \begin{equation}\label{šeima1}
%         v_1, v_2, \dots, v_s
%     \end{equation}
%     are linearly independent, and that each vector $v_i$, $1 \leq i \leq s$ of this family is linearly expressed in vectors
%     \begin{equation}\label{šeima2}
%         w_1, w_2, \dots, w_t.
%     \end{equation}
%     Then $s \leq t$, and there exists a subfamily $w_{j_1}, w_{j_2}, . . . , w_{j_s}$ of the vector family \eqref{šeima2}, which we replace by the vectors $v_1, v_2, . . . , v_s$, we get a family of vectors \eqref{šeima2} equivalent to the family \eqref{šeima2}.
% \end{lemma}

% \noindent The \emph{Remark} environment is for small remarks:

% \begin{remark}
% The condition of the theorem that the interval $[a, b]$ is compact and the function $f(x)$ is continuous on that interval is essential.
% \end{remark}

% \noindent Another environment \emph{Example} is used for short numerical or formula examples:

% \begin{example}
% Systems of equations
% \[
% \left\{
% \begin{array}{rclcl}
%     ax & + & by & = & e\\
%     cx & + & dy & = & f
% \end{array}
% \right.
% \]
% Kramer's formula for solutions:
% \[
% x = \frac{D_{x}}{D}, \qquad y = \frac{D_{y}}{D},\]
% here
% \[
% D=
% \begin{vmatrix}
% a & b\\
% c & d    
% \end{vmatrix}=ad-bc, \qquad
% D_x=
% \begin{vmatrix}
% e & b\\
% f & d    
% \end{vmatrix}=ed-bf, \qquad
% D_y=
% \begin{vmatrix}
% a & e\\
% c & f    
% \end{vmatrix}=af-ec.
% \]
% \end{example}

% \noindent The \texttt{proof} syntax is used to record evidence. Below is a proposition and a proof of that proposition. The end of the proof is automatically marked with the \square\ symbol by \LaTeX.
% \begin{proposition}
%   A square matrix $A$ is non-singular if and only if $\det A \ne 0$.
% \end{proposition}
% \begin{proof}
%     If $A$ is non-singular, then there exists a matrix $B$ such that $AB=I$. By the determinant property of the product of matrices,
%     \[
%         \det A \cdot \det B = \det AB = \det I = 1.
%     \]
%     Therefore, $\det A \ne 0$.
%     Now suppose that $\det A \ne 0$. Let $A^*$ be a transposed adjoint matrix. Then:
%      \[\begin{split}
%         A A^* =
%         \begin{pmatrix}
%             a_{11} & \dots & a_{1n} \\
%             \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
%             a_{n1} & \dots & a_{nn} \\
%         \end{pmatrix} \cdot
%         \begin{pmatrix}
%             A_{11} & \dots & A_{n1} \\
%             \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
%             A_{1n} & \dots & A_{nn} \\
%         \end{pmatrix} 
% &=  \begin{pmatrix}
%             \det A  & \dots & 0 \\
%                   0 & \ddots & 0 \\
%                   0 & \dots & \det A \\
%         \end{pmatrix}
%         \\
%         &=\det A \cdot
%         \begin{pmatrix}
%             1 & \dots & 0\\
%             0 & \ddots & 0\\
%             0 & \dots & 1
%         \end{pmatrix} = \det A \cdot I.
%     \end{split}\]

%     So, $A \cdot A^* = \det A \cdot I$. Dividing both sides of the identity by the $\det A \ne 0$ gives $A \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\det A}A^*\right) = I$. Similarly, we can show that $\left(\frac{1}{\det A}A^*\right) \cdot A = I$. Hence, $\frac{1}{\det A}A^*$ is the inverse of the matrix $A$, and hence $A$ is non-singular.
%     \end{proof}

%     \bigskip

%     Please note that mathematical environments are numbered automatically. Like formulas, mathematical definitions, statements, examples can be cited elsewhere in the text by first naming them with \texttt{\textbackslash label} and then creating a citation reference \texttt{\textbackslash ref} at the appropriate place. For example, we can quote Theorem \ref{teor1} or Lem \ref{lem1} in the places in the text where we need to refer to them.

% \subsection{Tables}

% If tables are presented, the table references should be mentioned in the text, for example: the \ref{tab:xydata} table shows some results.

% \begin{table}[H]
%     \centering
%     \caption{Tables are numbered at the top, caption is at the top}
%     \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
%         \hline
%         Column 1 & Column 2 & Column 3 \\
%         \hline
%          & &  \\
%          \hline
%          & & \\
%          \hline
%     \end{tabular}
%     \label{tab:xydata}
% \end{table}


% Each table must have a title, which, like the table number, must appear on the same line above the table. All tables shall be numbered consecutively (letter numbering is not recommended, e.g. Table 7a).

% \subsection{Images, graphs, charts, photos}
% If figures are used in the work, they must be mentioned in the text, e.g.:~\ref{fig:graph1}~ figure shows an example of how to present a figure.

% \begin{figure}[H]
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/AIC.png}
%     \caption{Figure numbers are at the bottom, caption is at the bottom}
%     \label{fig:graph1}
% \end{figure}


% Below is the text after the image.

% \subsection{Lists}

% Example of a non-numbered list:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item first element;
%     \item second element.
% \end{itemize}

% Example of a numbered lists:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item lorem ipsum dolor sit amet;

%     \item vivamus a nisl gravida.
% \end{enumerate}


% \section{Presentation of software code}
% This section outlines the way in which software code can be presented.

% \subsection{Algorithms}

% Algorithms are numbered in the same way as figures or tables. They must be mentioned in the text, e.g.:~\ref{alg:gd} is used to find the minimum value of the function $\mathcal{L}$.

% \begin{algorithm}[h]
% \caption{Gradual descent pseudocode}\label{alg:gd}
% \begin{algorithmic}[1]
%     \STATE \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{\textbf{\# We assume that $\mathcal{L}$ is defined in the text}}}
%         \STATE Input: $\mathcal{D}$ -- dataset
%         \STATE Input: $\theta_0$ -- initializing random values for parameters
%         \STATE Input: $\gamma$ -- learning rate, step size
%         \STATE Input: $m$ -- number of epochs
%         \FOR{$i = 1, 2, \dots, m$}
%             \STATE $\theta_i \coloneq \theta_{i-1} - \gamma \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D}, \theta_{i-1})$
%             \STATE \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{\textbf{\# The derivative of function $\mathcal{L}$ is calculated automatically by autograd}}}
%         \ENDFOR
% \end{algorithmic}
