# Human Benchmark  

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Edvinas11/human-benchmark)  

The project is designed to improve reflexes. Currently, there are two games that can be created with selected parameters:  
- **Reaction Time** (press as quickly as possible)  
- **Reflex Test** (played until 3 targets are missed)  

There is a **login system**, and games cannot be accessed without logging in. The project includes a **leaderboard**, where you can see the best results for each game, along with who achieved them and when.  
Instructions for running the project can be found in the `README.md` file.  

## TO-DO List  
- **Fix the STOP button** in the Reflex Test.  
- Adjust **game creation parameters** based on the game type (currently, all parameters are the same, including unnecessary ones).  
- Optimize **screen size handling** in games (Reflex Test is too easy to play on mobile devices).  
- Prevent scores from being submitted **before the game ends** (currently, random data can be entered via Swagger).  
- Allow users to **change the game image**.  
- Implement **private games** (currently, others' created games can override yours).  
- Add a **Moving Targets** game.  
- Enable players to **view their achievements** (high scores).  
- Add a **game history** for previously played games.  
- Provide **more information** about the games.  
- Implement a **light/dark theme** toggle.  
- Improve **sound design and VFX** for Reflex Test and Moving Targets.  
- Adjust **Reflex Test scoring** based on click speed and accuracy.  
- Create **different Reflex Test variations**:  
  - One where you play until missing a certain number of targets.  
  - Another with a **fixed number of targets**.  
- Enhance the **leaderboard UI** and expand functionality for different game variations.  
- Allow users to view the **top 10/top 20 players** for each game separately.  
- Implement a **rating system** for user-created gamesâ€”highly rated/popular games should be displayed higher in the list.
